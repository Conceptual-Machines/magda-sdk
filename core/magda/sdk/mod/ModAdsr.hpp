/**
 * @file ModAdsr.hpp
 * @brief The envelope generator: what it is, what stage it is in, and how far a
 *        block moves it.
 *
 * The LFO's three pieces, in the same arrangement and for the same reasons
 * (ModLfo.hpp says them at length). AdsrSettings is what the model says the
 * envelope is and rides in the published table; AdsrState is where it has got
 * to and belongs to the runtime; advanceAdsr is one block of the first applied
 * to the second.
 *
 * Two things differ from the LFO.
 *
 * The first is the gate. An LFO's trigger restarts a phase and a gate is
 * something extra a note-triggered one opts into; an envelope is nothing but a
 * gate, and its whole shape is the answer to how long the gate has been open
 * and how long ago it shut. So the gate is not optional here, and where it
 * comes from is what the sync mode selects: a free-running envelope holds its
 * gate open and cycles, a transport-locked one is gated by playback, and a
 * note-driven one is gated by whatever is feeding it notes.
 *
 * The second is when the value is read. The LFO publishes the phase the block
 * opens on and then moves the ramp; the envelope advances first and publishes
 * where the block ends up. The two are one block apart.
 *
 * What is deliberately not here, exactly as with the LFO, is depth and
 * polarity: one envelope drives several parameters by different amounts, and
 * MAGDA keeps that per link.
