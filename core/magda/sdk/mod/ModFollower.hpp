/**
 * @file ModFollower.hpp
 * @brief The envelope follower: the amplitude of something else, with an
 *        envelope on it.
 *
 * The one modifier that is not a function of time. An LFO, an envelope and a
 * random walk all answer "how far along are we"; this answers "how loud is
 * that", and the that is audio the modifier does not own. That is the thing
 * slice 4 could not build and the reason this one has to: a follower with no
 * source is a modifier with nothing to follow.
 *
 * Two halves, and they meet at a single number per block.
 *
 * The detector is the source's half. It takes the block of audio the source
 * produced, applies the follower's own input gain and its optional band limits,
 * and reduces the whole block to one peak. Per follower rather than per source,
 * because two followers on one track can be listening to different parts of the
 * spectrum, which is the point of the band limits.
 *
 * The envelope is this half. It runs a one-pole attack, hold and release over
 * that peak, sample by sample across the block, which is what
 * makes a follower's attack a time rather than a block count.
 *
 * ## Where the source's audio comes from, and when
 *
 * A block behind. The engine resolves every parameter at the top of a block and
 * then walks the ops, so the audio a follower is following does not exist yet
 * when the follower is asked what it is worth: the source's ops have not run.
 * What the follower reads is therefore the block before this one, deterministic
 * and always exactly one block.
 *
 * The alternative is to resolve a follower's targets after its source's
 * subgraph has rendered, which splits parameter resolution into two passes and
 * makes the order a plan-shaped question rather than a table-shaped one. That
 * is a structural change and it is not this slice's: the lag is bounded and
 * written down here rather than discovered later.
