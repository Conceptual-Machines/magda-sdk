/**
 * @file ModRandom.hpp
 * @brief The random modulator: a walk that takes one step per cycle, and what
 *        it does between steps.
 *
 * The LFO's arrangement again, and the LFO's timing exactly: rate in Hertz or
 * as a musical division, free-running, timeline-locked or trigger-restarted,
 * one value per block read at the block's first sample. What is different is
 * only what sits on the phase. An LFO reads a shape at it; this reads nothing,
 * and instead uses the phase wrapping as the moment to pick a new number.
 *
 * The walk is bounded rather than uniform: each step lands within
 * @ref RandomSettings::stepDepth of the one before it, so a small depth wanders
 * and a full one jumps anywhere in range. That is what makes the control mean
 * "how far it can move" rather than "how loud".
 *
 * Depth and polarity stay per link, as everywhere else in this system, which
 * is why the walk here runs in 0 to 1 and a link is what turns it into a swing
 * about a centre.
