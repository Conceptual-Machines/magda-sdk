/**
 * @file LevelTap.hpp
 * @brief What a Meter op writes and a meter reads.
 *
 * The plan is topology, so a Meter op names a location and owns nothing. This
 * is what stands behind it, and the host owns it for the same reason it owns a
 * device: it outlives the plans that reference it, so a structural edit
 * somewhere else in the project does not reset a meter that was reading.
 *
 * One writer (the audio thread) and one reader (whoever draws the meter). Two
 * readers would each take part of what the other was owed, because a read is
 * destructive; that is a property of metering rather than an oversight, see
 * read(). The writer/read interleavings are modelled in specs/tla/level_tap.

namespace magda::engine {

/**
 * @brief Peak level per channel, published without a lock.
 *
 * Stereo, because the plan carries no channel layouts and every audio port in
 * it is the context's channel count, which is two. A tap fed a wider block
 * reports the first two channels rather than folding them, because nothing in
 * the model says what the rest of them mean.

     * @brief Take the levels and start again. Off the audio thread.
     *
     * Destructive, and that is what makes a meter a meter: what it reports is
     * the loudest thing since it was last looked at, not the loudest thing in
     * whichever block the reader happened to land on. A non-destructive read
     * would let the frame rate decide how much of the signal the meter ever
     * sees, so a drum hit would show or not show depending on how busy the UI
     * was, and a meter that misses transients is worse than no meter.
     *
     * A tap nobody reads accumulates rather than growing: peak is a maximum, so
     * a meter that goes unwatched for a minute reports that minute's loudest
     * sample the next time it is read.
     *
     * Each channel is taken on its own, so a read is not one instant across the
     * two of them. A read landing between the channels of a write comes back
     * with one that has this block in it and one that does not, which on a
     * meter is a single frame where a signal shows on the left and not the
     * right. Nothing is lost to it: the channel that missed the read keeps its
     * level for the next one. Making the pair atomic means packing both floats
     * into one word, which is worth doing if that frame ever proves visible and
     * is not worth doing before.
