/**
 * @file SampleRing.hpp
 * @brief The recent past of a signal, for something that draws it.
 *
 * An oscilloscope and a spectrum want the same thing and neither wants a queue:
 * they want the last N samples whenever they happen to ask, and they would
 * rather miss what went by while they were not looking than fall behind it. So
 * the writer always overwrites the oldest sample and never blocks, and the
 * reader always sees the present.
 *
 * The same seam as LevelTap, for the other half of the tap question: a level is
 * one number per block, this is the samples themselves. An analysis device owns
 * one of these and the UI reads it; the engine writes it from process().
 */

namespace magda::engine {

/**
 * @brief A single-producer, single-consumer history of the most recent samples.
 *
 * Mono. Every analysis MAGDA draws (a trace, an FFT) is of the summed signal,
 * and a per-channel history would double the memory to be summed on the way out
 * anyway.
 *
 * Tearing is possible and bounded: if the reader stalls for as long as the ring
 * is deep, the writer laps it and the oldest few samples of what it copies are
 * from the new lap. At the default capacity that is a third of a second of
 * audio, which a UI would have to have stopped entirely to hit, and the cost
 * when it happens is one ragged frame of a drawing.
 *
 * The slots are atomic so that the lap is that and nothing more. Plain floats
 * would make it a data race, which is undefined rather than merely ragged: the
 * bound above would be a claim about what compilers happen to do, and the first
 * analysis device wired to a ring would hand `make tsan` a real positive, whose
 * only answers are a suppression that blunts the tool or a rewrite under time
 * pressure. Relaxed on both sides, because the ordering that matters is the
 * position counter's and the slots order nothing: what this compiles to is the
 * plain loads and stores it would have been anyway.
