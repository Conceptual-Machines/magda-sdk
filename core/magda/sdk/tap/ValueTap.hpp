/**
 * @file ValueTap.hpp
 * @brief What a block settled a value at, for whoever draws it.
 *
 * The third tap, and the one that reads back rather than measures (#2122). A
 * LevelTap answers how loud a point in the signal was and a MidiTap answers
 * what reached one; this answers what a number is. Two numbers, in fact, and
 * they are the same shape, so they are the same tap:
 *
 *  - what a modifier published this block, which is what a modifier editor
 *    animates, and
 *  - what a parameter resolved to once its base, its lane and its links had
 *    been settled against each other, which is what a device UI draws when
 *    something is modulating a knob, and what touch and latch would read at the
 *    moment a gesture starts.
 *
 * A normalised position, 0 to 1, in both cases. The parameter's own units are a
 * function of that position and its scale, and the scale belongs to the model,
 * which already has it; a tap that converted would be a second place the
 * conversion could be wrong.
 *
 * Bound by ParamKey, because that is the address of both: a modifier taken as a
 * source is a key with no parameter index and a parameter is a key with one,
 * and neither needs anything the other does not have (ParamKey.hpp).
 *
 * Owned by the host, for the reason a LevelTap is: it outlives the plans that
 * reference it, so an edit somewhere else in the project does not restate a
 * value something was reading.
 *
 * ## Why it is not a meter
 *
 * A read here is not destructive, and that is the whole of the difference. A
 * meter reports the loudest thing since it was last looked at because a
 * transient falling between two frames is a transient it must not miss. A
 * position has nothing of the kind to miss: what a knob draws is where the value
 * is, and where it was halfway between two frames is not a fact anybody is owed.
 * So the value stands until a block replaces it, any number of readers get the
 * same answer rather than taking it from each other, and a reader arriving late
 * reads the current position rather than a zero.
 *
 * ## Nothing simulates it
 *
 * A tap holds while the engine is not rendering, and holding is the right
 * answer: an LFO nothing is advancing is not turning, and an editor that
 * animated one anyway would be drawing a second LFO that agrees with the audible
 * one by accident and diverges from it under every retrigger. The value is
 * published by the block that produced it, so no such simulation is needed.
 *
 * @ref Reading::writes is what distinguishes a value that is holding from a
 * value that is not moving. It counts blocks published rather than changes, so
 * an editor with nothing to redraw has something to stop on, and a UI that
 * wants to know whether the engine is running at all can ask the value it is
 * already reading rather than the transport.
 *
 * ## What no writes means
 *
 * A count of zero is the one reading with a meaning of its own: nothing in the
 * engine publishes this value, so the model's own is the answer and the tap is
 * not part of it. That is not only the moment before the first block. The
 * parameter table carries a mixer value, a macro or a modifier's rate only when
 * something reaches it, because a project's faders and its sixteen macros per
 * scope are overwhelmingly numbers nothing moves; a tap on one of those has no
 * publisher and says so.
 *
 * Which means it has to be able to go back. A lane deleted off a fader takes
 * that fader out of the table, and a tap left counting from before would freeze
 * at the last automated position while claiming the engine had stopped. So a
 * publish that binds nothing to a tap clears it (see @ref clear), and the host
 * reads what is true: the engine has no opinion, ask the model.
 *
 * The count therefore never wraps to zero on its own. Thirty-three days of
 * continuous rendering at 96 kHz and 64 samples a block is not a number to
 * dismiss for an installation, and reaching it must not turn a live parameter
 * into one nothing publishes.
 *
 * ## Why the two of them are one word
 *
 * The count is what a reader gates a repaint on, so a reading that pairs one
 * block's count with another block's value is not a stale frame but a value
 * that never arrives. Read the value first and a reader can see the old value
 * beside the new count: it redraws with the old one, and at the next poll the
 * count has not moved again, so it decides nothing changed and the value it
 * never drew stays undrawn until something else writes. Read the count first
 * and the mirror image happens, with the fresher value thrown away for a count
 * that had not caught up. Neither order is a repaint's worth of wrong.
 *
 * So they are not two atomics. A float and a 32-bit count fit in one 64-bit
 * word, which every platform this builds for stores and loads in one
 * instruction, and a reading is then always one block's own: one store on the
 * audio thread, one load off it, no sequence lock and nothing to retry.
 *
 * One writer, the audio thread. Any number of readers.
