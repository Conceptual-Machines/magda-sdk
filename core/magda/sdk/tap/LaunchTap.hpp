/**
 * @file LaunchTap.hpp
 * @brief What a block left a slot doing, for whoever draws it (#2303).
 *
 * The launcher's read-back, following ValueTap.hpp. Position and state are one
 * 64-bit word so a reading is always one block's own. No write count, unlike a
 * value tap: a slot no block has advanced is stopped, which is what a button
 * should draw anyway.
 *
 * The position is fixed point rather than a float because a run accumulates for
 * as long as a clip plays: a float's step reaches 16 ms after three days at 120
 * bpm and 250 ms after thirty-three, so a playhead in a long-running set would
 * stall and jump (#2303 review).
 *
 * One writer, the audio thread. Readers on the publishing thread, whose
 * lifetime rule this follows (RuntimeStateStore::launchTap).
