/**
 * @brief The polyphonic sequencer: a chord per step, one chord at a time.
 *
 * The mono engine's rules with a chord in place of a note (#2313): a step's
 * notes sound together and release together, a tie holds them across the next
 * step, a rest or a failed probability roll ends them, and the gate countdown
 * releases the whole chord. Velocity comes from the step, or from a note that
 * overrides it.
 *
 * Like MonoStepSequencer the pattern is an argument, not a member: the model
 * owns it, and the device shell, the clip export and the tests all hand the
 * same value to the same engine.
