/**
 * @brief The 303-style monophonic sequencer: pattern and block in, notes out.
 *
 * Everything the mono step sequencer does between "the clock says step 5 fires
 * here" and "these notes sound" lives here (#2313): one voice at a time, rests,
 * ties that hold the previous note, glide that stretches a step to its full
 * length, accent velocities, and the gate countdown that releases a note some
 * blocks after the one that started it.
 *
 * The pattern is an argument, never a member: the model owns it and hands the
 * same value to whoever is playing. The device shell around this class supplies
 * the block, publishes what is sounding, and passes MIDI thru; the offline clip
 * export drives the same engine with synthetic blocks, which is what makes an
 * exported clip sound like the device.
