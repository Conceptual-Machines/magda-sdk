/**
 * @brief Tempo-synced step clock used by MIDI sequencer devices.
 *
 * Handles transport state tracking, beat position resolution, step timing with
 * swing, and step advancement in multiple direction modes.
 *
 * Tracks the next step's beat position directly rather than computing from a
 * fixed grid, so rate changes (e.g. from macro modulation) only affect future
 * steps and never cause note drops.
 *
 * Used by composition — each MIDI device that needs step-based timing owns a StepClock
 * and calls processBlock() each audio buffer to get the steps that fire within that block.
 *
 * Engine-neutral since #2313: the block's musical extent arrives as a
 * BlockTiming, so the clock never asks a host for a tempo sequence and both
 * engines' devices drive the same code.
