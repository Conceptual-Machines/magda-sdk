/**
 * @brief A pattern the model publishes and one audio thread plays.
 *
 * The model owns a step pattern (#2313) and the device is handed it, so every
 * edit crosses from the message thread to the audio thread while a block may
 * be reading. Two slots and an index are not enough on their own: an index
 * says which slot is current, not whether the audio thread still holds a
 * reference to the other one, so two publishes inside one block rewrote the
 * pattern being played and tore it (#2335).
 *
 * So the reader acknowledges. `liveSlot_` names the slot the audio thread may
 * read, and Hold TAKES it - exchanging it for kNoSlot - for as long as the
 * block needs it, putting it back on the way out. publish() fills the other
 * slot and hands it over with a compare-exchange that only succeeds while the
 * audio thread is holding nothing.
 *
 * The waiting is all on the message thread, and it is bounded: the audio
 * thread holds a slot for one device's process() and never waits for anything
 * itself. Nothing here allocates.
